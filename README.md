Website for the GP Summer Schools.

Each event has its on repository. If you are a collaborator on an event you can either fork the repo and submit pull requests, or you can ask to be added to a team associated with the event.

In general, for each repo the web pages are under the gh-pages branch. You can find the lecture list under

_data/lectures.csv

And there is some config information in 

_config.yml

Which can be edited for page titles, organiser urls etc. The pages are written in Jekyll.
